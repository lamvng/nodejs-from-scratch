# NodeJS from scratch

## Motivation

I am quite motivated to actually learn the language (JavaScript) & framework (NodeJS) since I deploy a lot of microservices written in Node. Sometimes, bugs happen and troubleshooting are needed. The ability to actually understand the language would help me a lot in collaborating with the Developers team to debug.

Since most of my development effort has been in Python (API writing & job automation), I will try to pick up some JavaScript particular features, and learn the rest on the go!

I am following these tutorials:

- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
- [Introduction to NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/)
